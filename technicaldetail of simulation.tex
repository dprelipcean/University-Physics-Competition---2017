2- The distance scale is set so that 50 units represents 12.5\times 10^{-4} [m].
3-We let 8 pixel per "timestep" represent 1.473 \times 10^4[m/s]
4-Each "timestep" (unit time in the simulation) hence will represent (\frac{ \frac{12.5\times 10^{-4}}{50} }{ \frac{1.473 \times 10^4}{8} } = 1.358e-08 [s]. Ideally (if there's no performance bottleneck), each timestep is (1/refresh_rate_of_monitor) [s]
5- flowrate kg per timestep = 3.2320399999999996e-13
